Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there\'s never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it\'s all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don\'t rent.

The game isn\'t this action-packed button-mashing thumb-buster on the system, but Advance Wars is incredibly intense and amazingly addictive...especially when you learn every little nuance of the game design. Single player mode is a challenge in itself, but when you get another player (or three) into the battlefield, that\'s when you see just how versatile the game design really is. The learning curve has been addressed with a well-designed and integrated tutorial mode that must be completed in order to gain access to the rest of the game.\r\n\r\nI hesitated giving this game a perfect 10, and decided to knock a single tenth of a point simply due to a problem in the link cable mode. Since it\'s turn-based, the players who are not involved sit and watch the player in charge making his move -- it would have been extremely helpful to add a function to let these players check on their troops during the move...especially when enemy forces are moving into their territory. In single player mode, the computer AI moves so fast that you wouldn\'t have much time to check your stats anyway...but when you\'re sitting idle after a turn, your mind should be working strategically, and to not have the ability to see your troops\' status is a bit annoying.\r\n\r\nBut that\'s really the only true complaint I can make about the game.\r\n\r\nAdvance Wars is an absolutely brilliant design, and a title that absolutely deserves a place in your Game Boy Advance collection. It will be amazing to see this series continue in the states, simply because the design is near perfect as it is. What could they possibly do to the game to make it better? ', '2001-09-01'),

However, I am quite disappointed by the vacation theme and Nintendo\'s stubborness to pay attention to presentation. The story and character design especially is poorly executed. I think Nintendo finds making Peach into a total ditz and Mario into a fat goon amusing, but it feels pretty lame for those of us with some intelligence. If Nintendo truly didn\'t care about the story, then it shouldn\'t have even bothered to offer up the poorly done, compressed FMV sequences.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, though, Super Mario Sunshine is about gameplay. Its depth easily passes by all of the problems with presentation, sound, and visuals.

I will have no problem going on record as saying that the GBA version of Pokemon will be the top-selling videogame released in 2003...for all systems. There\'s no doubt here that this game will sell like gangbusters.\r\n\r\nBut regardless of the fact that a Pokemon game is pretty much a license to print money, this is one of the most involved RPG titles released, and one hell of a ride on the Game Boy Advance. Nintendo took an already great design and made it better on the GBA, and while it\'s a bit more than a little disappointing to see a lack of focus in the graphics department, it\'s the sheer amount of \"stuff\" in the product that makes Pokemon for the Game Boy Advance a really, really great game.

Developer 343 Industries has engineered the strongest combat Halo has ever seen, with tons of excellent weapons, varied maps, an expansive and intense new multiplayer mode joining a host of returning greats, and some game-changing new mobility. At the same time, Guardians repeats Halo 4’s mistake of telling a story that can’t stand on its own without Halo’s expanded universe. This hurts, but doesn’t ruin, its otherwise impressive cooperative campaign. In its 14 years, Halo has never felt so good to play. An updated arsenal and great new mobility mechanics give both campaign and multiplayer and modern touch without sacrificing Halo’s classic feel. It fails to introduce its new Spartan characters in a meaningful way, and the story does make some odd logical leaps, but it’s still fast, beautiful, and fun – especially with four-player co-op.

With Pikmin, it looks as though Nintendo has managed to create a successful marriage of the two disparate elements. One part dark struggle for survival and one part cute fairy tale, Pikmin is an engaging game with the twisted charm found in a good Tim Burton movie. \r\nPikmin\'s story will put you in the role of the bald and bulbous-nosed Captain Olimar. After an asteroid hits his ship, the Dolphin, he\'s forced to crash-land on a strange planet. Assessing the damage, he realizes he\'s stuck--unless he recovers the pieces of his ship that broke off during the crash. To make matters worse, his space suit\'s life support will fail after 30 days. However, just when it looks like he\'ll be pulling a Tom Hanks in Cast Away without the happy ending, he stumbles upon some native life that may just save the day. Sprouts dispensed from a large onionlike creature yield small creatures that Olimar dubs \"Pikmin\" after a carrot from his homeworld.
